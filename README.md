# 32-Bit ALU in Cadence (Verilog HDL)

## 📖 Overview
This project implements a **32-bit Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)** using Verilog HDL.  
The design was created and simulated in **Cadence**, showcasing the working of core arithmetic and logic operations used in processors.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- Verilog HDL  
- Cadence Simulation Environment  
- Digital Design Concepts  

## 📂 Project Structure
src/ → Verilog source code

testbench/ → Testbench code

screenshots/ → Simulation outputs & waveform

## 🔑 Features
- 32-bit addition, subtraction, AND, OR, XOR, etc.  
- Pipelined structure for better performance  
- Testbench verification with sample inputs  

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone this repository ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheAmrutaHub/32-Bit-ALU-Cadence.git

Open in Cadence or any Verilog simulator

Compile and run testbench (alutest.v)

Observe waveforms in the simulator
